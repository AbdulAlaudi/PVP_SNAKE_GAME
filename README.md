# PVP_SNAKE_GAME

# run the main.py file to start up the program

# This is a 1v1 game where each user controls a snake
# The arrow keys will control the blue snake
# red snake will be controlled by the a,w,s,d keys

# Each snake has a head; getting a snake head to touch the green food will make that snake grow in size. 
# Touching the white food will shorten your snake; a longer snake's head touching the smaller snake will make the longer snake grow, and the shorter snake shorten
# when a snake only has its head left, eating the white food or getting touched by the longer snake's head will cause the shorter snake user to lose the game
