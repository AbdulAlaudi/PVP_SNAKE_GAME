# PVP_SNAKE_GAME

# run the main.py file to start up the program

# this is a 1v1 game where each user controls a snake
# blue snake will be controlled by the arrow keys
# red snake will be controlled by the a,w,s,d keys

# each snake has a head, getting a snake head to touch the green food will grow that snake
# touching the yellow food will shorten your snake, a longer snake's head touching the smaller snake will make the longer snake grow and the shorter snake shorten
# when a snake only has the head left, eating the yellow food or getting touched by the longer snake's head will cause the shorter snake user to lose the game
